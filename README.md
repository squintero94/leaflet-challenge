For this challenge I utilized the previous activities from class for guidance, especially the geoJSON activity from week 15 day 1 and the Citi bike activity from week 15 day 3.

Xpert AI was also of assistance for a few things such as an issue I was having with setting up the legend. 

I was trying to find a resource with the color options for the markers in leaflet to match the example provided. Nothing was really of any help, though I ended up utilizing some insight I gained from this link:
